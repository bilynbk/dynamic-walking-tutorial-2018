# dynamic-walking-2018

This repository contains the content for the tutorial at Dynamic Walking Conference 2018.

It aims to introduce the IHMC simulation envrionment: Simulation Construction Set, and more particularly to introduce the IHMC whole-body controller core that is used for the walking algorithms of several robots such as the humanoid robots Atlas and Valkyrie.
